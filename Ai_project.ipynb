              "'Deep in the darkest part of your heart\\nEvery beat seems to be a trying slow start\\nPride and victory have no place here\\nReasonable thoughts are placed on the back burner\\nEvery breath  difficult and heavy\\nSeasons all remain the same, cold, dark and gloomy\\nStereotypical behaviour is quite apparent\\nIn the quiet darkness you reside\\nOn a deep running  slow train\\nNever, yes it never seems like you’ll come back again\\nA little soul scarce fledged for earth\\nTakes wing with heaven again for goal\\nEven while we hailed as fresh from birth\\nA little soul.\\nOur thoughts ring sad as bells that toll,\\nNot knowing beyond this blind world\\'s girth\\nWhat things are writ in heaven\\'s full scroll.\\nOur fruitfulness is there but dearth,\\nAnd all things held in time\\'s control\\nSeem there, perchance, ill dreams, not worth\\nA little soul.\\nThe little feet that never trod\\nEarth, never strayed in field or street,\\nWhat hand leads upward back to God\\nThe little feet?\\nA rose in June\\'s most honied heat,\\nWhen life makes keen the kindling sod,\\nWas not so soft and warm and sweet.\\nTheir pilgrimage\\'s period\\nA few swift moons have seen complete\\nSince mother\\'s hands first clasped and shod\\nThe little feet.\\nThe little hands that never sought\\nEarth\\'s prizes, worthless all as sands,\\nWhat gift has death, God\\'s servant, brought\\nThe little hands?\\nWe ask:  but love\\'s self silent stands,\\nLove, that lends eyes and wings to thought\\nTo search where death\\'s dim heaven expands.\\nEre this, perchance, though love know nought,\\nFlowers fill them, grown in lovelier lands,\\nWhere hands of guiding angels caught\\nThe little hands.\\nThe little eyes that never knew\\nLight other than of dawning skies,\\nWhat new life now lights up anew\\nThe little eyes?\\nWho knows but on their sleep may rise\\nSuch light as never heaven let through\\nTo lighten earth from Paradise?\\nNo storm, we know, may change the blue\\nSoft heaven that haply death descries\\nNo tears, like these in ours, bedew\\nThe little eyes.\\nWas life so strange, so sad the sky,\\nSo strait the wide world\\'s range,\\nHe would not stay to wonder why\\nWas life so strange?\\nWas earth\\'s fair house a joyless grange\\nBeside that house on high\\nWhence Time that bore him failed to estrange?\\nThat here at once his soul put by\\nAll gifts of time and change,\\nAnd left us heavier hearts to sigh\\n\\'Was life so strange?\\'\\nAngel by name love called him, seeing so fair\\nThe sweet small frame;\\nMeet to be called, if ever man\\'s child were,\\nAngel by name.\\nRose-bright and warm from heaven\\'s own heart he came,\\nAnd might not bear\\nThe cloud that covers earth\\'s wan face with shame.\\nHis little light of life was all too rare\\nAnd soft a flame:\\nHeaven yearned for him till angels hailed him there\\nAngel by name.\\nThe song that smiled upon his birthday here\\nWeeps on the grave that holds him undefiled\\nWhose loss makes bitterer than a soundless tear\\nThe song that smiled.\\nHis name crowned once the mightiest ever styled\\nSovereign of arts, and angel:  fate and fear\\nKnew then their master, and were reconciled.\\nBut we saw born beneath some tenderer sphere\\nMichael, an angel and a little child,\\nWhose loss bows down to weep upon his bier\\nThe song that smiled.\\nKneel down, fair Love, and fill thyself with tears,\\nGirdle thyself with sighing for a girth\\nUpon the sides of mirth,\\nCover thy lips and eyelids, let thine ears\\nBe filled with rumour of people sorrowing;\\nMake thee soft raiment out of woven sighs\\nUpon the flesh to cleave,\\nSet pains therein and many a grievous thing,\\nAnd many sorrows after each his wise\\nFor armlet and for gorget and for sleeve.\\nO Love\\'s lute heard about the lands of death,\\nLeft hanged upon the trees that were therein;\\nO Love and Time and Sin,\\nThree singing mouths that mourn now underbreath,\\nThree lovers, each one evil spoken of;\\nO smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine\\nCame softer with her praise;\\nAbide a little for our lady\\'s love.\\nThe kisses of her mouth were more than wine,\\nAnd more than peace the passage of her days.\\nO Love, thou knowest if she were good to see.\\nO Time, thou shalt not find in any land\\nTill, cast out of thine hand,\\nThe sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee,\\nAnother woman fashioned like as this.\\nO Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in her\\nWas made a goodly thing;\\nYea, she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss,\\nWith her fair kiss, and lips much lovelier\\nThan lips of amorous roses in late spring.\\nBy night there stood over against my bed\\nQueen Venus with a hood striped gold and black,\\nBoth sides drawn fully back\\nFrom brows wherein the sad blood failed of red,\\nAnd temples drained of purple and full of death.\\nHer curled hair had the wave of sea-water\\nAnd the sea\\'s gold in it.\\nHer eyes were as a dove\\'s that sickeneth.\\nStrewn dust of gold she had shed over her,\\nAnd pearl and purple and amber on her feet.\\nUpon her raiment of dyed sendaline\\nWere painted all the secret ways of love\\nAnd covered things thereof,\\nThat hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine;\\nRed mouths of maidens and red feet of doves,\\nAnd brides that kept within the bride-chamber\\nTheir garment of soft shame,\\nAnd weeping faces of the wearied loves\\nThat swoon in sleep and awake wearier,\\nWith heat of lips and hair shed out like flame.\\nThe tears that through her eyelids fell on me\\nMade mine own bitter where they ran between\\nAs blood had fallen therein,\\nShe saying; Arise, lift up thine eyes and see\\nIf any glad thing be or any good\\nNow the best thing is taken forth of us;\\nEven she to whom all praise\\nWas as one flower in a great multitude,\\nOne glorious flower of many and glorious,\\nOne day found gracious among many days:\\nEven she whose handmaiden was Love--to whom\\nAt kissing times across her stateliest bed\\nKings bowed themselves and shed\\nPale wine, and honey with the honeycomb,\\nAnd spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering;\\nEven she between whose lips the kiss became\\nAs fire and frankincense;\\nWhose hair was as gold raiment on a king,\\nWhose eyes were as the morning purged with flame,\\nWhose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence.\\nThen I beheld, and lo on the other side\\nMy lady\\'s likeness crowned and robed and dead.\\nSweet still, but now not red,\\nWas the shut mouth whereby men lived and died.\\nAnd sweet, but emptied of the blood\\'s blue shade,\\nThe great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes.\\nAnd sweet, but like spoilt gold,\\nThe weight of colour in her tresses weighed.\\nAnd sweet, but as a vesture with new dyes,\\nThe body that was clothed with love of old.\\nAh! that my tears filled all her woven hair\\nAnd all the hollow bosom of her gown--\\nAh! that my tears ran down\\nEven to the place where many kisses were,\\nEven where her parted breast-flowers have place,\\nEven where they are cloven apart--who knows not this?\\nAh! the flowers cleave apart\\nAnd their sweet fills the tender interspace;\\nAh! the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss\\nEre their fine gold was tarnished at the heart.\\nAh! in the days when God did good to me,\\nEach part about her was a righteous thing;\\nHer mouth an almsgiving,\\nThe glory of her garments charity,\\nThe beauty of her bosom a good deed,\\nIn the good days when God kept sight of us;\\nLove lay upon her eyes,\\nAnd on that hair whereof the world takes heed;\\nAnd all her body was more virtuous\\nThan souls of women fashioned otherwise.\\nNow, ballad, gather poppies in thine hands\\nAnd sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves\\nRain-rotten in rank lands,\\nWaste marigold and late unhappy leaves\\nAnd grass that fades ere any of it be mown;\\nAnd when thy bosom is filled full thereof\\nSeek out Death\\'s face ere the light altereth,\\nAnd say \"My master that was thrall to Love\\nIs become thrall to Death.\"\\nBow down before him, ballad, sigh and groan.\\nBut make no sojourn in thy outgoing;\\nFor haply it may be\\nThat when thy feet return at evening\\nDeath shall come in with thee.\\nStab me with your rusty knives\\nI don\\'t care\\nI\\'ve given up my quest for acceptance\\nLeft my dream of peace\\nCut me all your evil mind wants\\nI beg you to let me die\\nI want to lie here on the floor\\nBleed to nothingness in the night\\nPerhaps then my soul will fly\\nUnite with the wind and muggy air\\nFeel the warmth of joy\\'s arms\\nSo do what you want to my useless heart\\nChop me to pieces or burn me alive\\nIf death is my only way to salvation\\nThen I want to open the darkened door now.\\nAnd this is just another sad song\\nI can\\'t deny that I\\'ve been needing one\\nAnd that the world is always at fault\\nAnd we did nothing, how did we do wrong?\\nAnd I\\'ve been thinking that when we thought\\nThe world would break us that we weren\\'t wrong\\nBut it\\'s just never been the world outside\\nAnd sonder kinda has me terrified\\nAnd I\\'m so sorry I can\\'t find the time\\nSpent all my days over-preoccupied\\nAnd I\\'ve been thinkin\\' \\'bout how I\\'d react\\nIf you were me and I was ghosted out\\nAnd I know I should try more\\nBut I\\'ve been so caught in my own small shit that I can\\'t see\\nPast the nothing around me here\\nBut I\\'ve been trying really fuckin\\' hard not to try so hard\\nReally fuckin\\' hard to just let go\\nReally fuckin\\' hard not to try so hard\\nAnd realize I\\'ve nowhere left to go\\nAnd I said what\\'s up? What you been thinking?\\n\\'Cause you\\'ve been staring at that roof so long, I swear it\\'s come alive\\nAnd she spoke nine words and now we\\'re sinking\\nBut I can\\'t find it in myself to want to lie to keep this thing from going down\\n\\'Cause that girl took my heart\\nAnd I ain\\'t want it back\\nNo\\n\\'Cause you said it meant nothing\\nAnd I should\\'ve kept my silence\\nBut I guess I\\'m too attached to my own pride to let you know\\nThat all these words meant nothing\\nAnd I\\'ve always been this heartless\\nBut we\\'re just having sex, no, I would never call it love\\nBut love\\nOh, no, I think I\\'m catching feelings\\nAnd I don\\'t know if this is empathy I feel\\nJust hold on\\nRemember why you said this was the last time?\\nI\\'m laying down my cards\\nAnd what\\'s good\\nWhen both choices I\\'ve got\\nHave us staring down the barrel to the bullets I can\\'t stop?\\nAnd so I stand off like indecision\\'s Kevlar\\n\\'Til this fear of feeling stops and I\\'m done\\nBut you\\nNo, I don\\'t know how to forget you\\nNo, I don\\'t know how to forget you\\nNo, I don\\'t know how to forget you\\nNo, I don\\'t know how to forget you\\nOh, no, I think I\\'m catching feelings\\nAnd I don\\'t know if this is empathy I feel\\nJust hold on\\nRemember why you said this was the last time?\\nNo, I don\\'t know how to forget you\\nNo, I don\\'t know how to forget you\\nNo, I don\\'t know how to forget you\\nNo, I don\\'t know how to forget you\\n\\'Cause I had the best of the worst sides\\nAnd I had these lungs, ohh\\nAnd I had too many

was it, & the meadows slept,\\nThe misty hills dreamed, and the silent wood\\nSeemed listening to the sorrow of my mood:\\nI knew not if the earth with me did grieve,\\nOr if it mocked my grief that bitter eve.\\nThen ’twixt my tears a maiden did I see,\\nWho drew anigh me on the leaf-strewn grass,\\nThen stood and gazed upon me pitifully\\nWith grief-worn eyes, until my woe did pass\\nFrom me to her, and tearless now I was,\\nAnd she mid tears was asking me of one\\nShe long had sought unaided and alone.\\nI knew not of him, and she turned away\\nInto the dark wood, and my own great pain\\nStill held me there, till dark had slain the day,\\nAnd perished at the grey dawn’s hand again;\\nThen from the wood a voice cried: “Ah, in vain,\\nIn vain I seek thee, O thou bitter-sweet!\\nIn what lone land are set thy longed-for feet?”\\nThen I looked up, and lo, a man there came\\nFrom midst the trees, and stood regarding me\\nUntil my tears were dried for very shame;\\nThen he cried out: “O mourner, where is she\\nWhom I have sought o’er every land and sea?\\nI love her and she loveth me, and still\\nWe meet no more than green hill meeteth hill.”\\nWith that he passed on sadly, and I knew\\nThat these had met and missed in the dark night,\\nBlinded by blindness of the world untrue,\\nThat hideth love and maketh wrong of right.\\nThen midst my pity for their lost delight,\\nYet more with barren longing I grew weak,\\nYet more I mourned that I had none to seek.\\nThe world has lost the ear for rhyme.\\nIt still makes children squirm with pleasure;\\nand from some witty pens and minds, its fireworks fizz;\\nso, after all these centuries of rhyme\\nand all the games of meter, dancing words,\\nshould we now mourn its passing?\\nHave we lost the music of another world?\\nInstead, the easy unpretentious discourse,\\nsober, light, familiar, honest -\\nthe world of daily, homely, shared sharp life,\\nthat\\'s now preferred. Not prose;\\nmuch more than \\'chopped-up prose\\' as those may say\\nwho think that poetry should be more visibly hard-earned;\\n- as if a human life set down in honesty\\nwere not a poem in itself, unwrit;\\n\\'prose with enhanced consciousness\\' it\\'s often now defined;\\nand consciousness - now that\\'s earned, if you like...\\nand simile, and imagery, and metaphor - all the repertoire\\nof glorious poetry - they\\'re all still here\\nto work their magic; if more played down, now,\\nunostentatious as T-shirt and jeans;\\nunostentatious as the beating, bloody heart.\\nAnd yet, when years bring tears\\nand time brings death and dying,\\nit\\'s time for rhyme, to heal the heart\\nand charm away the crying.\\nLost in a world, that scares me to death,\\nLost in a crowd, I\\'m losing my breath.\\nLost as a boy, lost as a man,\\nI need to grow up, don\\'t think I can.\\nLost as a person, can\\'t find my way.\\nLost in life, every day.\\nLost in worry, who am I?\\nAll my life, I\\'ve lived a lie.\\nLost to kindness, lost to love,\\nLost in a sky, like a new-born dove.\\nLost in thought, which I shouldn\\'t do,\\nIt winds me up, I can’t get through.\\nLost to comfort, all kind words,\\nLost to advice, it isn\\'t heard.\\nLost to those who really care,\\nAll these people, always there.\\nLost in me, I need a break,\\nLost in wonder, which road to take?\\nLost in a place I don\\'t know well,\\nWhere are you now?

Jumping the old coal train to make a few cents,\\nvery little gain indeed.  Looking back once again, I see\\nthe danger of the act, for what was profited certainly\\nwasn’t worth all that.  A word to the young, “stay out\\nof harms way, remain honest and true,  the coal train\\nwas not for me and certainly not for you.\\nWhat went wrong?\\nRunning on empty\\nI waited years in a past

feels like home\\nBeen a long life, still got mad time\\nTook a wrong right on it last time \\nThrough the long night, made it out alright\\nTold my brother, \"Hold tight\"\\nSometimes I can feel it, I can feel it\\nSometimes I still Sometimes I still\\nNowhere feels like home\\nSometimes I feel Sometimes I feel\\nNowhere feels like home\\nSome times\\nSo tell me this is who you are, yeah\\nThey tell me I\\'ve got something more\\nAnd oh, you could be loved\\nBut I don\\'t want the lights to find me\\nWhen I\\'m dark and lost, but never on my own\\n\\'Cause I just wanna swing like

or end it, and\\nThen maybe they\\'ll remember me when I\\'m gone\\nThat\\'s all I could ever want\\nThat\\'s all I want\\nSo I got ten minutes to be all or nothing to whoever wants to hear\\nAnd I got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat till I\\'m burnt out and disappear\\nBut I owe you nothing\\nAnd I own my luck\\nOh, they said, \"You\\'ll never be alone again\"\\nBut I don\\'t think you understand me or what I fear\\n\"But you could be loved\"\\nBut I don\\'t wanna lie to tell myself\\nI\\'m more than all the mistakes I\\'ve outrun\\n\\'Cause I\\'m only here for a minute\\nAnd I don\\'t care what you say \\'cause I know\\nYou\\'re only here \\'cause I\\'m winning\\nBut I can be my own kind of rock and roll, I\\nI don\\'t really care if you say you don\\'t fuck with me\\nAnd I can say what the fuck I want \\'cause it\\'s down to me\\nAnd I got love for you even if you are doubting me\\nLike, oh my God, I just can\\'t stop\\n\\'Cause I just wanna sing like Sinatra with ethanol my soundtrack\\n\\'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone\\nI wonder how it feels to burn out young, yeah\\n\\'Cause I just wanna die before my heart fails from heartbreak or cocktails, and\\nThen maybe you\\'ll cry once you know I\\'m gone\\nThat\\'s all I could ever want, oh, that\\'s all I want, yeah\\n\\'Cause it\\'s all we\\'ve got, what are we breathin\\' for if we ain\\'t

you have to\\nNow, I\\'ll be fine if you ever ask me\\nI know it\\'s hard, but no one said, it\\'s easy\\nFalling\\'s easy, but there\\'s only one way up\\nSo I\\'ve been thinking that I think too much\\nAnd I can\\'t sleep but I can dream of us\\nAnd I\\'ve been seeing shit like horror cuts\\nIt\\'s burning down, I gotta drown this out\\nAnd you said, you need me to let this go\\nBut it\\'s who I am or am I just losing it?\\n\\'Cause you said jump and I went first, but falling\\'s always been my downfall\\nAnd you say I drink and I smoke and I talk too much\\nBut I know, you lie when you said that you just had enough and save yourself\\nSo hear me out\\nYou know everybody talks, girl and it means nothing till you let it\\nAnd if you keep second guessing, then there\\'s only gonna be one end\\nBut you can leave if you really want to\\nAnd you can run if you feel you have to\\nAnd I can drink if I feel I have to\\nI know it\\'s hard, but I can\\'t feel like I used to, like I used to\\n\\'Cause I used to defy gravity, defy gravity\\nGoodbyes keep dragging me down\\nAnd I\\'m fighting gravity, defying gravity\\nI tried, but I keep falling\\n\\'Cause falling\\'s easy, but it only brings you down\\nDon\\'t know how well this is gonna be\\nBut, the basic idea is\\nFree fall for now\\nDesert air won\\'t drown you out\\nAnd for a second I thought the world was ending\\nAnd I couldn\\'t breathe in\\nYeah, and so this isn\\'t your time\\nYeah, been chasing kairos with those scapegoat eyes\\nCan\\'t you realize?\\nFuck the summertime, it\\'s you\\nSo scared of overgrowing youth\\nWhen it\\'s not done with you\\nAnd everybody gon\\' run, run\\nEverybody gon\\' run, run\\nAnd you can call it what you want\\nBut I call it moving on\\nAnd I\\'m so done with singing words I don\\'t believe in no more\\nSo what you rushing for?\\nWho said it\\'s now or never?\\nI think you\\'re taking on the wrong advice\\nBut it\\'s alright if these are your worst times\\nYou know you\\'re good\\nYou\\'re good\\nAnd if you want you can breathe on your own\\nThis isn\\'t what I thought but it\\'s beautiful\\nMake peace with your mistakes and they\\'ll turn to gold\\nWeightless, I let go\\nAnd everybody gon\\' run, run\\nEverybody gon\\' run, run\\nAnd you can call it what you want\\nBut I call it moving on\\nAnd I\\'m so done with singing words I don\\'t believe in no more\\nNo more, call it what you want\\nCall it what you want but I call it growing up and I\\'m done\\nSo I\\'ve been thinkin\\' \\'bout something\\nLately, I\\'ve been alive\\n\\'Cause I found my reason in nothing\\nSo I won\\'t close my eyes\\n\\'Cause I don\\'t want to miss one second\\nAnd I don\\'t want to feel so cold\\nAnd I don\\'t want to be so sad that we are, who we are\\n\\'Cause we had no control\\nBut only by the night\\nWill we ever make headlines\\nWill we ever make things right\\nWhen we\\'ve only ourselves to blame\\nWhen we\\'ve only ourselves to blame\\nSo I won\\'t sleep, no more\\nNo, I won\\'t sleep, no more\\n(I won\\'t sleep, no more)\\nI always thought that there\\'d be more than just wishing my life away\\nLike I could always\\nFigure it out and never have to abandon what\\'s in front of me\\n(Dream no more)\\nSo get this doubt out of my head\\nIt\\'s only real if you let it\\nAnd I\\'ve been letting go of my ghosts\\nI\\'ll never let them catch me no more\\nThese words are all I have, so I\\'ll just keep dreaming out loud\\nAnd if I just keep talking, maybe I\\'ll figure all of this out\\nBut only by the night\\nWill we ever make headlines\\nWill we ever make things right\\nWhen we\\'ve only ourselves to blame\\nAnd we\\'ve only ourselves to blame\\nSo I won\\'t sleep, no more\\nNo, I won\\'t sleep, no more\\nNo, I won\\'t sleep\\nI always thought that there\\'d be more than just wishing my life away\\nLike I could always\\nFigure it out and never have to abandon what\\'s in front of me\\nDream no more\\nYou came in through my window, you left without a sound\\nYou’re floating through my ceiling,\\u2005eyes\\u2005fixed on the\\u2005ground\\nAm I holding you up?\\nA block\\u2005in the road, no effort to sinking\\nLife’s always telling you\\u205fto\\u205fgo\\n\\'Cause\\u205fwe’re just waiting\\u205fon a signal,\\u205fwe’re looking for a sign\\nOblivious to changes, grasping at the time\\nNo hope in searching outward, no truth beyond the line\\nMelding at your edges, transmuting lost time\\nStill wherever you go\\nLove will surround you\\nLove will surround you\\nLove will surround you\\nLove will surround you\\nAm I holding you up?\\nA block in the road, no effort to sinking\\nLife’s always telling you to go\\n\\'Cause we’re just waiting on a signal, we’re looking for a sign\\nOblivious to changes, grasping at the time\\nNo hope in searching outward, no truth beyond the line\\nMelding at your edges, transmuting lost time\\nBut still wherever you go\\nLove will surround you\\nLove will surround you\\nSo let me go if you wanna\\nDon’t let me know that I’m lost \\'cause I just wanna feel wanted\\nNo revolution, no blood, blood, blood, blood\\nSo rushing in and rushing out again\\nAnother martyr, I know\\nSo you can wake up and start again\\nFrom stardust to gold\\nMaybe in another man\\'s life\\nOn another man\\'s time\\nMaybe the time just not right for us\\nMaybe this is all that we are, are\\nThe lives I\\'ve loved\\nToo close to know\\nThe hindsight song\\nThere\\'s no way I\\'d rather wait than know\\nThe highs we trade for the lows\\nJust gotta wake up and start again\\n\\'Cause this is no place like home\\nAnd if you could\\'ve stayed there you would\\'ve\\nCould\\'ve, should\\'ve\\nAnother life I loved\\nMaybe the time will be right for us\\nIf this is all that we\\'ve got, I got\\nThe lives I\\'ve loved\\nAnd too close to know\\nChasing, but at what cost?\\nJust \\'cause there\\'s no way I\\'d rather wait than know\\nI know it hurts sometimes\\nBut you\\'ll get over it\\nYou\\'ll find another life to live\\nI know you\\'ll get over it\\nI know you\\'re sad and tired\\nYou\\'ve got nothing left to give\\nBut you\\'ll find another life to live\\nI know you\\'ll get over it\\nSo when you\\'re caught in a landslide\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nAnd in the rain, give you sunshine\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nAnd every time that you\\'re lonely\\nAnd every time that you\\'re feeling low, you should know\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nI\\'ll be there for you, you know\\nI know your hope is heavy\\nBut you\\'ll get over it\\nYou\\'ll find another life to live\\nI know you\\'ll get over it\\nAnd I know you feel like everything\\nIs falling to the wind\\nBut don\\'t you let the thunder in\\n\\'Cause I know you\\'ll get over it\\nSo when you\\'re caught in a landslide\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nAnd in the rain, give you sunshine\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nAnd every time that you\\'re lonely\\nAnd every time that you\\'re feeling low, you should know\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nI\\'ll be there for you, you know\\nYou fell down by the wayside\\nLove locked in an overflow\\nAnd you threw stones at the starlight\\n\\'Cause I stood on the sidelines telling you\\nThat I get that you\\'re lonely\\nAnd I see that you feel alone\\nBut I heard in a heartbeat\\nI\\'ll be there for you, you know\\nSo when you\\'re caught in a landslide\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nAnd in the rain, give you sunshine\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nAnd every time that you\\'re lonely\\nAnd every time that you\\'re feeling low, you should know\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nI\\'ll be there for you, you know\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nI\\'ll be there for you, you know\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nI\\'ll be there for you, you know\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nI\\'ll be there for you, you know\\nAnd every time that you\\'re lonely\\nAnd every time that you\\'re feeling low, you should know\\nI\\'ll be there for you, I\\'ll be there for you\\nI\\'ll be there for you, you know\\nStep out into the sun\\nSkies above they radiate me\\nLift up, carry the love\\nDo you know?\\nThat I\\'ve been out of my mind\\nThis slow life I\\'m waiting for you\\nTo swing me all of your line\\nDo you know?\\nSince I\\'ve been walking solo\\nDreaming you were back home\\nHi-fi getting down low\\nHide until tomorrow\\nCome back into the good life\\nLose these hazy love lies\\nI\\'ve been chasing my mind\\nLonely in the cold nights\\n\\'Cause I\\'m kicking up stones without you\\nCan\\'t pick up the phone without you\\nI\\'m a little bit lost without you\\nWithout you\\nAnd I\\'m digging down holes without you\\nCan\\'t be on my own without you\\nI\\'m a little bit lost without you\\nWithout you\\nStep out into the dark\\nWhere were you when I was trying\\nTo lift up, carry the love?\\nDo you know?\\nThat I\\'ve been closing my eyes\\nLove me slow, hallucinating\\nSwinging me all of your light\\nDo you know?\\nSince I\\'ve been walking solo\\nDreaming you were back home\\nHi-fi find getting down low\\nHide until tomorrow\\nCome back into the good life\\nLose these hazy love lies\\nI\\'ve been chasing my mind\\nLonely in the cold nights\\n\\'Cause I\\'m kicking up stones without you\\nCan\\'t pick up the phone without you\\nI\\'m a little bit lost without you\\nWithout you\\nAnd I\\'m digging down holes without you\\nCan\\'t be on my own without you\\nI\\'m a little bit lost without you\\nWithout you, oh\\nHold me close when it\\'s over\\nLife goes slow loving sober\\nFeel my bones getting older\\nSadness grows when you\\'re cold\\n\\'Cause I am one step heavy and two steps high\\nHold it steady with you by my side\\nOne step heavy and two steps high\\nTwo steps high\\n\\'Cause I\\'m kicking up stones without you\\nCan\\'t pick up the phone without you\\nI\\'m a little bit lost without you\\nAnd I\\'m digging down holes without you\\nCan\\'t be on my own without you\\nI\\'m a little bit lost without you\\nWithout you\\nWithout you\\nWithout you\\nI\\'m a little bit lost without you\\nWithout you\\nAnd I\\'m digging down holes without
